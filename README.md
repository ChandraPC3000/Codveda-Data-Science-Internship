## 🚀 Overview

Throughout the internship, I explored various aspects of data science including:

- Data Collection and Web Scraping
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling (Regression)
- Classification with Logistic Regression
- Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- Time Series Analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Classification
- Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras

Each task is organized clearly by level and includes code notebooks, visuals, and documentation.
