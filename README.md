# 🤖 Codveda Internship - Data Science Projects

Welcome to the repository for my internship project at **Codveda Technologies**!    
This repository includes all the tasks I worked on during my **Data Science Internship**, spanning three different levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

---

## 📋 Overview

Throughout the internship, I explored various aspects of data science including:

- Data Collection and Web Scraping
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling (Regression)
- Classification with Logistic Regression
- Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- Time Series Analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Classification
- Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras

Each task is organized clearly by level and includes code notebooks, visuals, and documentation.

## 🎓 What I Learned

✅ Gained experience in collecting and scraping data from various online sources using libraries like **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium**.

✅ Learned to clean and preprocess datasets by handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and normalizing/standardizing data for analysis.

✅ Mastered techniques for visualizing and summarizing data, identifying trends, and exploring relationships using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

✅ Applied regression models (such as Linear Regression) to predict numerical values and assess model performance through metrics like RMSE and R².

✅ Developed a solid understanding of classification techniques, particularly **Logistic Regression**, for predicting categorical outcomes and evaluating performance through accuracy and confusion matrices.

✅ Explored clustering techniques like **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** for grouping similar data points without labeled outputs.

✅ Gained expertise in analyzing temporal data, forecasting future trends, and handling time series with libraries like **statsmodels**.

✅ Built models for text classification using **NLP** techniques like tokenization, vectorization, and sentiment analysis with **spaCy** and **NLTK**.

✅ Worked on building and training deep learning models using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, including neural networks for classification tasks.
