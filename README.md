# 🧠 Codveda Internship - Data Science Projects

Welcome to my internship project repository for **Codveda Technologies**!  
This repo contains all the tasks I completed during my **Data Science Internship**, covering three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Throughout the internship, I explored various aspects of data analytics including:

- Data Collection and Web Scraping
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling (Regression)
- Classification with Logistic Regression
- Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- Time Series Analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Classification
- Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras

Each task is organized clearly by level and includes code notebooks, visuals, and documentation.
